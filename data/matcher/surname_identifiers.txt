#	This file contains surname identifiers for Dutch for person names 
#	for the NE-matcher, for use if perFilter = true. 
#
#	The NEMatcher assumes that the surname identifiers
#	mark the beginning of a surname in a name that consists of more than one
#	word. E.g. the surname identifier 'van' tells the NE-matcher that in the name
#	'Jan van der Broek', the surname starts at word index = 1. Thus, it assumes that
#	all words preceding 'van' are given names.
#
#	NOTE: identifiers have to be lowercase.
